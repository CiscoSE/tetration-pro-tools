# Tetration Pro Tools

## Introduction
Cisco Tetration is a powerful Zero Trust policy discovery and enforcement engine that also provides a native software-defined distributed firewall.  To support better collaboration with application teams, it is sometimes helpful to share policy in a visual or spreadsheet format.  This extension provides enhanced policy export for Tetration Policy Workspaces in CSV and Visual Map (SVG) formats.

## Usage
Tetration Pro Tools requires a user to be logged into a Tetration environment and have a policy workspace open in the tab.  Right click anywhere on the page and select the appropriate option to export in the desired format.

## Attribution
Tetration Pro Tools uses [viz.js](https://github.com/mdaines/viz.js) which is a Javascript implementation of [Graphviz](http://www.graphviz.org/) to layout and render the Visual Policy Map in SVG format.
